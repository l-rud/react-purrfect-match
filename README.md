## Project Title: "Purrfect match"              

## Project Description:            
                    
Purrfect match is an entertainment web application that uses publick API - [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/) to create a quiz that allows users to identify a cat breed that matches their personality.          
### How it works:        
**1. Personality Assessment:** Users select values for seven personality traits from dropdown menus.     
**2. Rating System:** Each trait is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the lowest level of that trait.         
**3. Breed Matching:** The application fetches a list of cat breeds and identifies the breed that best matches the specified traits.    
**4. Random Cat Image:** After identifying the matching breed, the app displays a random image of a cat of that breed and information about the breed.

This project is a refactored REACT version of the original Purrfect Match web application, which was built using vanilla JavaScript. You can view the original project [here](https://github.com/l-rud/purrfect-match-web-app).
